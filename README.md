## Features

- Three buttons:
  - **Play**: Start the game
  - **Difficulty**: Adjust snake speed
  - **Reset**: Reset the score

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, movement, and interactions

## How to Play

2. Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls and yourself.
